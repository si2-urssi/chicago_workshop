In this workshop, we want to:

* Help attendees meet each other and understand their goals
* Get answers for our survey and encourage further distribution of the survey
* Talk about ethnographic studies
* Present a set of topics that we think will be potential areas of work in a future institute
* Identify a subset of these, plus additional topics that are potentially important to the community, to discuss further
* Refine, merge, discard topics
* Document the workshop’s results

We want to come out of this workshop with:

* An informed and enthused set of attendees (including a group photo)
* A list of candidate topics for an institute, some of which may be well-understood
* Thoughts on institute roles - what could an institute do to address the topics?
* Thoughts on institute organization - how could an institute be organized to do this?
