# chicago_workshop
We are excited to welcome you to the second workshop in the URSSI conceptualization October 23 and 24 in Chicago, IL. Similar to our first workshop in Berkeley, the event will be mostly participant driven. In addition to a few keynotes and lightning talks, the agenda includes open discussions around topics suggested by participants prior to and during the meeting.

In this workshop, we want to:

* Help attendees meet each other and understand their goals
* Get answers for our survey and encourage further distribution of the survey
* Talk about ethnographic studies
* Present a set of topics that we think will be potential areas of work in a future institute
* Identify a subset of these, plus additional topics that are potentially important to the community, to discuss further
* Refine, merge, discard topics
* Document the workshopâ€™s results

We want to come out of this workshop with:

* An informed and enthused set of attendees (including a group photo)
* A list of candidate topics for an institute, some of which may be well-understood
* Thoughts on institute roles - what could an institute do to address the topics?
* Thoughts on institute organization - how could an institute be organized to do this?
